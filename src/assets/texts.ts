  "~_welcome": "Welcome to my portfolio page!\nThis is my first full fledged React project, \
more specifically this is the Command-Line Interface (CLI) experience \
and my first take on simulating a terminal environment.\nThis experience tries to replicate \
and remain faithful to the terminal experience, so it may be a little difficult traversing \
this experience as a first timer if you are not used to managing a terminal.\n\n\
Some neat things to note:\
\n\t+ Autocomplete using Tab for commands/directories\
\n\t+ Core commands, use help for more info. Here are some useful commands:\
\n\t\t> cat (view files)\
\n\t\t> ls (list files in directory)\
\n\t\t> cd (change directories)\
\n\t+ Project stats / info are dynamically updated\
\n\t+ Loads of API calls (Not abusing calls, I swear!)\
\n\t+ echo, color, and backtick functionalities of commands for fun :)\
\n\t+ Cheeky secrets laid around!\
\n\n\
Some not-so-neat things to note:\
\n\t- Erroneous results with autocomplete with more than 1 argument\
\n\t- Would certainly restructure this project again, better backend design\
\n\t- Still a work in progress project!",

  "Documents_info": "Here you are able to view some of my accomplishments!\n\
To view more details on a project, you can use the same cat command on a .proj file (still case sensitive!)\
\n\nYou'll see up-to-date stats on my GitHub Repositories, as the data provided are fetched live (and cached for those who are wondering)",

  "Downloads_info": "I am still not too sure what to do with this directory...\
\nSo if you see this, then hello! You caught this prior to being ready :)",
  "Music_info": "Here you are able to see my most favored playlists!\
\nInterestingly enough, you're able to suggest some songs and add to my suggestions playlist, \
I'll try to get to it as soon as possible! I am always open to new music.",

  "Pictures_info": "Just like documents, I am not sure what I will do with this. Hey pt2!",
  "Videos_info": "You won't believe me when I say... do I need to even say it? Hey pt3 :)"
