          more specifically this is the Command-Line Interface (CLI) experience \
          and my first take on simulating a terminal environment.\nThis experience tries to replicate \
          and remain faithful to the terminal experience, so it may be a little difficult traversing \
          this experience as a first timer if you are not used to managing a terminal.\n\n\
          Some neat things to note:\
          \n\t+ Autocomplete using Tab for commands/directories\
          \n\t+ Core commands, use help for more info. Here are some useful commands:\
          \n\t\t> cat (view files)\
          \n\t\t> ls (list files in directory)\
          \n\t\t> cd (change directories)\
          \n\t+ Project stats / info are dynamically updated\
          \n\t+ Loads of API calls (Not abusing calls, I swear!)\
          \n\t+ echo, color, and backtick functionalities of commands for fun :)\
          \n\t+ Cheeky secrets laid around!\
          \n\n\
          Some not-so-neat things to note:\
          \n\t- Erroneous results with autocomplete with more than 1 argument\
          \n\t- Would certainly restructure this project again, better backend design\
          \n\t- Still a work in progress project!",

          This is my first full fledged React project, more specifically this is the Graphical User Interface (GUI)\

          This experience tries to replicate and remain faithful to the file system / desktop environment experience.\
          My speciality and interests is more towards backend development, so the frontend presentation may not look 100%\
