          Hey! I am Jhon Tabio. I am the creator of JTOS, the operating system the server you are currently connected to is using.<br/>
          Currently an undergraduate student that is pursuing a Bachelors in Computer Science at the University of Central Florida. Throughout my educational and professional career, I have adopted various industry and social skills that allows me to easily integrate myself in any sort of team environment. Every day I work towards refining my skills in C / C++ / C#, Java, Javascript, Typescript, Python, and HTML / CSS using tools such as Visual Studio / Visual Studio Code, VIM / NeoVim, Git, and GitHub. One of my greatest achievements is having the chance to work alongside Microsoft and their TEALS division to bring more accessibility of computer science to High schools that did not have a strong CS program. I was able to gather the communication skills and patience to teach a group of high schoolers about the fundamentals of programming.

          Not. The reality is that the OS as a whole is more of an artistic simulation rather
          than an emulation. The idea is I wanted to challenge myself with my weaker side of
          Full Stack Development, which is Front End Development. I could have easily minimized
          the use of Components, and React overall, with emulating a terminal in Javascript / Typescript.
          Taking the approach I did forced me to not only use React, but strategize how I wanted
          core parts of this simulation to work.

          It was not too long ago where I had switched my working station from a Windows machine to a Linux machine.
          Since then, I have been enjoying the use of a terminal more than a GUI interface for the purposes
          of work. I emphasize work, because I most certainly still use Windows for leisure and entertainment :)
